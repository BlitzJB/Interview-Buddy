## Motivation
Technical interview preparation often lacks integration between coding proficiency and communication skills. Interview Buddy aims to address this gap by providing candidates with a platform to improve their coding skills and communication clarity.

## Objectives
Interview Buddy's objectives include:
- Offering diverse coding scenarios
- Providing real-time feedback
- Enhancing speech clarity and coherence
- Conducting performance evaluation

## Existing Systems
Existing platforms like LeetCode Interviews and Google's Interview Warm-Up offer coding challenges but lack speech analysis and personalized guidance.

## Literature Survey
Research literature such as "Enhancing Coding Interview Practice with Real-Time Feedback Systems" and "Towards Automated Coding Interview Feedback with Natural Language Processing" inspired the development of Interview Buddy.

## Proposed System Design
The system design includes modules for user profile creation, audio analysis, interactive interview preparation, live coding environment, database management, scoring and evaluation, and personalized guidance.

## Implementation
Interview Buddy is implemented using the following tech stack:
- Frontend: Next.js with lexical analysis
- Backend: FastAPI with Llama/Gemini for audio analysis
- Data Storage: PostgreSQL for database management
- Cache & Session Management: Redis
- Other components: LangChain for resume analysis and NLP, Coqui AI TTS for audio feedback

## Results
Key features of Interview Buddy include personalized interview preparation, live coding environment, scoring-based feedback system, real-time audio analysis, instant syntax checking, and tailored coding challenges.

## Impact / Results
The platform fosters continuous learning, encourages skill development, provides equal access to preparation resources, offers personalized support, and supports inclusive growth in the tech industry.
